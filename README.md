An app for identifying toxic comments

Our command has used 'SkolkovoInstitute/russian_toxicity_classifier' - Bert-based classifier (finetuned from Conversational Rubert) trained on merge of Russian Language Toxic Comments dataset collected from 2ch.hk and Toxic Russian Comments dataset collected from ok.ru.

A comment is given at the input, the degree of toxicity and neutrality is at the output.

The application is implemented using FastApi.
